# Security-Hardening-Plan

This deliverable FMJ2 was tasked to create a security hardening plan for Design World’s infrastructure. The plan provided a concise overview of the essential configuration changes that FMJ2 implemented to increase Design World’s cybersecurity posture and protection. This plan was done in four phases:

## Phase 1: 
Took place after a vulnerability assessment and penetration test were done to help identify crucial vulnerabilities that needed immediate attention by prioritizing based on their criticality level, considering Design World's unique needs, objectives, and NIST security requirements. 

## Phase 2: 
FMJ2 relied on the DISA STIG viewer as a dependable resource. This extensive guide provided optimal industry practices and recommended configurations for various operating systems, with a focus on addressing the previously identified vulnerabilities.

## Phase 3: 
FMJ2 relied on the expertise of our security experts to establish policies that effectively prevented the recurrence of configuration mistakes. The policies incorporated the best practices to be followed by all employees, ensuring a holistic approach to security.

## Phase 4: 
Hardened images were created, allowing Design World to replicate them across their domain. That will ensure consistent and secure configurations throughout their environment. Additionally, FMJ2 provided clear policy documentation tailored to the specific needs of Design World. The documentation served as a comprehensive guide for implementing and maintaining the necessary security measures within the company.
The proposed hardening plan focused exclusively on two subnets: 
·	172.16.102.0/24
·	172.16.120.0/24
The plan outlined security measures implemented to strengthen the Windows security system of Design World. The report provided an overview of the hardening activities performed, the reasoning behind each measure, and the expected impact on the system's security.
